### Vehicle Recognition - Demonstration Notebook

This is a demonstration notebook of training a deep architecture ([MobileNet V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)) on an unsupervised image dataset of vehicle models from a marketing site. This dataset was analysed in depth during my previous work of [*Transfer learning approach for classification and noise reduction on noisy web data*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418301878?via%3Dihub)\". In this notebook, the architecture is trained on the entire noisy dataset with two learning strategies. In the first one, the network is thorouly trained and fine-tuned on the dataset, and in the second approach, the network is used as a feature extractor and the features are classified using a linear support vector classifier.
