### Vehicle Recognition Project - Android Demo Application
This project is an android application which demonstrates the methods discussed in the paper "Transfer Learning Approach for Classification and Noise Reduction on Noisy Web Data". It has the capability of recognizing the models of a group of specified vehicles. The classifier used in this project is trained on a noisy dataset gathered from web sources, hence, the learning process is done in a weakly supervised manner. The project has been tested on the Lollipop version of Android. You can find the source and the pre-built binary file in the Github repository.
